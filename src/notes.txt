Issues Resolved

I looked around and found that the package 'aws-amplify-angular' doesn't really work with Angular 9 and above. I have even tried with 11 and it does the same.

The solution is to migrate from 'aws-amplify-angular' to '@aws-amplify/ui-angular'

Steps for integration are available here - https://docs.amplify.aws/ui/auth/authenticator/q/framework/angular
